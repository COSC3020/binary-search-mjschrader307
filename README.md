# Binary Search

Implement a binary search function that, given a sorted list and an element to
look for, returns the index of the element in the list or -1 if the element is
not there.

Use the template in `code.js`. The tests in `code.test.js` will be run
automatically every time you push to Github; if they pass you are done.

Help Received:

- I asked ChatGPT for a suggestion on how to avoid using array slicing, because I discovered that it is hard to keep track of the original element index when calling the function on different arrays each time.
  - It suggested using a wrapper function
